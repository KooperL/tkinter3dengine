# Important

This app uses `python 3.x`.

# About

This project creates a fully rasterized 3d scene, with a light source and non-fixed camera. It spawns one model of each `.obj` file in the `models/` folder. This project was one of my first written in python, the code lacks organisation and might not be optimized nor use best practices. For the foreseeable future, I will not be updating this repo, however everything is working.

# Installation

`tkinter`, and all other libraries are included in the standard library for `python 3.x`, so further installations are not needed.
Simply `python main.py` from the command line to run it.

# Getting started

Modify the entry point of the app to alter object spawns. Use the following controls to move around the scene.

## Controls:

- `w`: Forwards
- `s`: Backwards
- `a`: Left
- `d`: Right
- `q`: Up
- `e`: Down
- `i`: Pitch Up
- `k`: Pitch Down
- `j`: Yaw Left
- `l`: Yaw Right
